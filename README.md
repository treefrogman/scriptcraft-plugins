# Scriptcraft Plugins
I'm using [Walter Higgins' excellent ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft) Minecraft Server plugin to write my own Minecraft plugins.

I also created a datapack and am migrating as much as I can from scriptcraft to the datapack because something something native functionality (yeah, I know I'm using a JS wrapper instead of native Spigot, I'm a hypocrite).

I've added a set of recipes specifically to enhance skyblock by allowing the player to craft end portal frame blocks and spawn eggs for missing mobs, and to smelt coal/charcoal into diamond. I don't think it's OP. It requires a blast furnace, and one diamond takes a whole blaze rod to smelt. Also, piglins now barter for nether wart and both nyliums.
